# LibManage
You are tasked with developing an inventory and checkout system for a library. It should include
a front-facing interface for members to search for resources (e.g., books) and view their
availability, as well as allow library employees to manage inventory and process checkouts and
returns. We would also like a small event scheduling system for events the library is running,
and members should be able to view these events when interacting with the system.
While this system is not required to be developed to be accessed via the web, it must be able to
be run on multiple different machines while accessing a central database (you will run a
database locally for testing and development, but it should function as if you were connecting to
a database on a central server). You will gather more detailed requirements at an upcoming
client meeting with your project manager/TA.

Course Specifications:
● Implements user authentication

● Implements a dynamic database of user and item data

● Implements one or more “operations” involving some form of frontend-backend-database communication

Course Expectations:
● Databases can use any existing dataset or have dummy data. Databases using datasets should have at least 100 items. There can be exceptions based on the specific project.

● New User creation/registration should be available

● UI design should contain elements commonly found or expected such as a user profile, login, logout.

● Consideration for design aesthetics

● System should be dynamic and responsive
